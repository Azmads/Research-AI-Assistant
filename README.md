Final Agent Project for ITAI 2376

- Our project is a hybrid AI chatbot designed to integrate OpenAI’s GPT-4o model with practical tools for document processing, file analysis, and real-world input handling. The agent allows users to upload files such as PDFs, Excel sheets, and CSVs. It then determines the content type and uses the appropriate tools to extract and interpret the data. The agent offers summarization, data analysis, and content recognition, blending conversational intelligence with technical utility.
This agent is not just a chatbot—it is a modular digital assistant that performs real-world data tasks such as summarization of research PDFs, automated calculations from Excel files, and numeric insight extraction from CSVs. We aimed to emulate how human analysts parse information from multiple modalities, combining linguistic understanding with structured data processing. The broader goal is to reduce manual workload for students, researchers, and professionals who interact with large amounts of data in various formats.
